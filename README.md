# Dodo

Dodo is a Chrome extension that automatically organizes your downloads into folders by file type and/or download URL.   

I originally wrote Dodo back in 2014, then abandoned the project. For whatever reason, I've decided now (the very beginning of 2017) is a good time to finally release it!
